- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael Chukwuemeka Ekwonu
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep learning applications in fluid dynamics, Flow visualization with 4D-PTV using shake-the-box, BOS, 3D-PIV, LIF and schlieren.
- 🌱 I hold a PhD in Mechanical Engineering
- 👨‍🔬 I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Advanced Experimental Fluid Dynamics Lab, School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulsan, South Korea 
      and working on collaborators on 4D PTV flow visualization with data assimilation, BOS and quantification of spray visualization, Bubble-induced vibration and turbulence, Scientific machine learning of Biolfuid/Fluid         dynamics.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to a tenure-track faculty position in future
